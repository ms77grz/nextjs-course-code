# Section 9

## Project Time: API Routes

In this secition we’re going to add a new newletter registration flow, a component that allows a visitor to enter an email address and then store that email address somewhere with help of API routes. And we’re going to add a comments feature, where we can comment on an event. So w’ll also add a form feature there. And when the form is submitted, that entered comment data should be stored on the backend with help of API routes. And when we load a single event, we also want to be able to load the comments when the user wants to view the comments section.
